This repo is for storage of any problems I solve related to the Free Code Camp curriculum.
Though I'm only storing my solutions to the challenges presented (and not the actual lessons). 
Here is the Table of Contents for the Front-End portion:

#Basic Algorithm Scripting#

The first set of problems are basic algorithms and they are allotting 50 hours. 

After 18 months of scripting across a few languages I guess I have gotten a lot faster because I was able to knock out the first 10 of these basic problems last night in the 3-5 hours between when I finished my dinner and when I went to bed.
